Although answers thus far are right yet they have not covered the issue comprehensively i.e. in relation to others countries or international standards. I will try to elaborate the prices in Islamabad are on the higher side compared to the standard of living, facilities offered. The reasons are as follows :-

1.Property Mafia. Property dealers have become a mafia, laundering money, evading taxes, breaking laws by exploiting loopholes, etc. In absence of computerized land records, no one asking for source of investment, outdated laws and corrupt beaurucracy, property dealers do as they please. Due to lack of regulation any tom, dick and harry starts real estate agency there are no requirements, no registration, no license, absolutely nothing. Secondly, there are frontmen of criminals who make investments to whiten money obtain through bribery, tax evasion, money transferred from abroad via hawala, hundi, etc. This mafia has become so powerful that many property dealers are in cabinet and government directly making policies.

2. No Alternative. Islamabad is only planned city in Pakistan development by the government. This is the reason it is quite clean, organized and well planned. Although in recent years Capital development authority has tried its level best to ruin Islamabad as much as possible yet it is head and shoulders above any other city specially next to god forsaken, garbage dumb that is Rawalpindi.

3. Politics Yes politics as i elaborate above property dealers have become mafia who fund politicians, are politicians and effect policies. This somehow lead to some unintended consequences. If you end up funding or supporting wrong political party you will end in jail or intermittently between jail, court and cabinet. Consequently many housing societies are declared illegal and investors lost millions and billions. However most of Islamabad particularly CDA, sectors remained lawful and people trust that their investments are safe.

4. Capital development authority or CDA, it is one of the most corrupt institution operating at times like bunch of thieves and goons. In middle of city you have entires sectors illegally occupied e.g.G-12 or meherabadi, Nust, E-11, and many others. Its collaboration with property dealers to screwover investors is legendary. Its failure to develop new, sectors or announced schemes, like I-11 to I-16. Powerful babus not allowing local government institutions to operate and utter chaos in terms of town planning and development.

5. Money Laundering for decades Pakistan elite is using property to launder money. Bribes are invested in property than shown to be sold many times its original value to whiten money. Its no coincidence that many ministers, bureaucrats, judges are involved in property business. Fun fact in the UK you cannot transfer money from Pakistan claiming you earned through property. UK will not accept such money as legitimately sourced. Policies like DC rate are in place for this purpose exactly to cheat the system, invest without revealing the source of income and invade taxes.

6. Elitism how federal government has failed to equally develop or treat all sectors E and F sectors were elites reside have entirely different outlook than G and I sectors. As most beaurucrats, politicians, retired judges and general reside in E and F sectors you will hardly see broken roads, unmaintained parks. Ridiculously enough you can have houses valued above 2 million US dollars. I used to be amazed at the prices. Now I have understood that you can get away with murder having right connections in Islamabad. Your 2 million dollars are well spent living in Islamabad. No other country will offer you such systemized corruption veiled in religious hypocrisy.
