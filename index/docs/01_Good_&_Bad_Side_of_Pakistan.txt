====== 01 Good & Bad Side of Pakistan ======
Created Wednesday 05 July 2023

month long project, release it 05 Aug 2023

why isn't pakistan on the map? why don't people know about it?
most people don't know even the basics of pakistan.
for most ordinary people, it's known for OBL.
and he wasn't even from pakistan. his career was not based here.
it's just where he was killed.

**MILITARY. ACTION. EXCITING.**


pakistan's population is 	233,726,707
number of orphans 		  4,500,000

active-duty personnel		560,000
reserve force			550,000
National Guard			185,000
civilian personnel		 16,500
manned aircraft			   ~560+



pakistan's military is ranked amongst one of the top militaries of the world.
owing to its access to many natural resources and available military manpower
among other things.

pakistan is a military state with a corrupt non-functional democractic part.
there's too many bigots in pakistan to have a functioning democracy.

pakistan is a democracy.
no wait it's an islamic state.
no wait it's a military state.
you know what it's a failed state.
pakistan is an orphan of the british empire and the ottoman empire.
abandoned on the thar desert.

pakistan is an orphan really.

[TODO transition]

**NATURE. RELAXING. MAJESTIC.**
[order of creation]
the indian continent smashed into asia.
and the mountains were born.
and they're ever rising.

and then the rivers came down.
like india is named after the indus river.

it's a dream location for film makers.




**ORPHANS. SAD. DRAMATIC.**

who is the most vulnerable? who is the easiest to steal from?
who can you hurt without any consequence in this world?

someone who can't fight back. in fact, doesn't even know to fight back.

what's even more horrific is that you can raise a child to
consider your abuse as acts of great sacrifice and kindness.

such is the story of so many of the children of pakistan.
many of them suffer abuse both at home and in the streets.

willful negligence by their parents.

a huge amount of kids end up in the streets as orphans where they are
drugged and abused. there's no adoption or foster care system.

the bigots consider birth control to be against their religion.
abstinence is considered evil. in fact some bigots preach people who
don't get married and have kids end up in hell!

there's kids who are homeless inside their homes. abused by the people
who are supposed to protect them.

parents believe they own their kids. any disobedience is evil.
child labor.

what dangers face a child in the streets?
the case of Zainab!
[[+Was suspect Imran Ali known to his neighbours]]
[[+wikipedia|+wikipedia Murder of Zainab Ansari]]

Indian media's response was one of admiration instead of the usual vitriol.

there are so many souls whose suffering here never made the news.
there were no protests. protests all muffled.
so many cries for help unanswered.


one of the worst things you can give someone trapped in such
an environment is false hope. leading them to their demise while
promising an escape to the garden.

include the reddit post by that doctor with malnourished baby!

OUTRO TO ORPHANS
but how can you make it worse for a child?


**POLLUTION. ANGRY. BITTER.**

pakistan is twice the size of california but 7 times as many people. üôÇÔ∏è
1 / 10th the GDP tho. üò¢Ô∏è
and people say cali is overpopulated. ‚ùìÔ∏è


or 3 times the size of UK. yet it has the 5th largest population.


The population density in Pakistan is 287 per Km2 (742 people per mi2).

a baby is born every 5 seconds. üò©Ô∏è
by the time you finish watching this video
there'd be a 180 more pakistanis. ü§ØÔ∏è
...and 45 japanese people would be dead.
at this rate all anime chars will have beards. üòµ‚Äçüí´Ô∏è
[anime char morphing into pk style]

from big to small cities, the streets are filled with open sewage.
trash everywhere. trash including discarded plastic is burned. which
further pollutes the air.

lahore, pakistan's second largest city was rated the most polluted in the
world recently.


particles from partially burned up fuel gets collected into the air during the hot day.
as the evening sets in, and the suns starts to go down, so does the smoke.
it engulfs the cities and suburbs, any population around a highway,
gets to inhale the remnants of the public commute.
